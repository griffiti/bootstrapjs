BootstrapJS provides on-demand script loading with automatic script load detection and callback notification. Boot groups, including group ordering, provide developers with a way to define dependencies, support group level callbacks, and more.

Debug and verbose modes provide developers with integrated feedback on script loading. A load report can be accessed for load time statistics.

Splash screen support provides developers with a easy to use load time enhancement.

In order to build bootstrapjs, run the following command from the current project directory. You will need Java 1.7 or higher installed. You will also need a copy of JSBuilder2.

```
java -jar /path/to/JSBuilder2/JSBuilder2.jar -p ./build.jsb2 -d .
```
