BootstrapJS provides on-demand script loading with automatic script load detection and callback notification. Boot groups, including group ordering, provide developers with a way to define dependencies, support group level callbacks, and more.

Debug and verbose modes provide developers with integrated feedback on script loading. A load report can be accessed for load time statistics.

Splash screen support provides developers with a easy to use load time enhancement.
